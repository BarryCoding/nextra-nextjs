title: Dynamic Routes

> Dynamic Routes are pages that allow you to add custom params to your URLs.

When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time  
and want to create routes from dynamic data,  
you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or [prerendered](/next-page/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths) at build time.

## Convention

A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a file or folder name in square brackets: `[segmentName]`.

Dynamic Segments can be accessed from [`useRouter`](/next-page/api-reference/functions/use-router).

## Best Practices

For example:  
a blog could include the following route `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`  
where `[slug]` is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return <p>Post: {router.query.slug}</p>
}
```

| Route                   | Example URL | `params`        |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` | `/blog/a`   | `{ slug: 'a' }` |
| `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` | `/blog/b`   | `{ slug: 'b' }` |
| `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` | `/blog/c`   | `{ slug: 'c' }` |

### Catch-all Segments

Dynamic Segments can be extended to **catch-all** subsequent segments  
by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets `[...segmentName]`.

For example, `pages/shop/[...slug].tsx`

| Route                      | Example URL   | `params`                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `pages/shop/[...slug].tsx` | `/shop/a`     | `{ slug: ['a'] }`           |
| `pages/shop/[...slug].tsx` | `/shop/a/b`   | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`      |
| `pages/shop/[...slug].tsx` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |

### Optional Catch-all Segments

Catch-all Segments can be made **optional**  
by including the parameter in double square brackets: `[[...segmentName]]`.

The difference between **catch-all** and **optional catch-all** segments is that  
with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (`/shop` in the example above).

| Route                        | Example URL   | `params`                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].tsx` | `/shop`       | `{ slug: undefined }`       |
| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].tsx` | `/shop/a`     | `{ slug: ['a'] }`           |
| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].tsx` | `/shop/a/b`   | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`      |
| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].tsx` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |
