> Create your first page and shared layout with the Pages Router.

The Pages Router has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.  
When a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.

In Next.js, a **page** is a [React Component ↗](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) exported from a `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory.  
Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

**Example**:  
If you create `pages/about.tsx` that exports a React component like below,  
it will be accessible at `/about`.

```tsx
export default function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}
```

## Index routes

The router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the directory.

- `pages/index.tsx` → `/`
- `pages/blog/index.tsx` → `/blog`

## Nested routes

If you create a nested folder structure, files will automatically be routed in the same way still.

- `pages/blog/first-post.tsx` → `/blog/first-post`
- `pages/dashboard/settings/username.tsx` → `/dashboard/settings/username`

## Pages with Dynamic Routes

For example:  
if you create a file called `pages/posts/[id].js`,  
then it will be accessible at `posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.

> To learn more about dynamic routing, check the [Dynamic Routing documentation](/next-page/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).

## Layout Pattern

The React model allows us to deconstruct a **page** into a series of components.  
Many of these components are often reused between pages.

For example:  
you might have the same navigation bar and footer on every page.

```tsx filename="components/layout.tsx"
import Navbar from './navbar'
import Footer from './footer'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />
      <main>{children}</main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

### Single Shared Layout with Custom App

If you only have one layout for your entire application,  
you can create a [Custom App](/next-page/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) and wrap your application with the layout.  
Since the `<Layout />` component is re-used when changing pages,  
its component state will be preserved (e.g. input values).

```tsx filename="pages/_app.tsx"
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

### Per-Page Layouts

If you need multiple layouts, you can add a property `getLayout` to your page,  
allowing you to return a React component for the layout.  
This allows you to define the layout on a _per-page basis_.  
Since we're returning a function, we can have complex nested layouts if desired.

```tsx filename="pages/_app.tsx"
import type { ReactElement, ReactNode } from 'react'
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

// 1 create a new type for your pages which includes a getLayout function.
export type NextPageWithLayout<P = {}, IP = P> = NextPage<P, IP> & {
  getLayout?: (page: ReactElement) => ReactNode
}

// 2 create a new type for your `AppProps`
type AppPropsWithLayout = AppProps & {
  // overrides the Component property to use the previously created type.
  Component: NextPageWithLayout
}

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppPropsWithLayout) {
  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available
  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)

  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/index.tsx"
import type { ReactElement } from 'react'
import Layout from '@/components/layout'
import NestedLayout from '@/components/nested-layout'
import type { NextPageWithLayout } from './_app'

const Page: NextPageWithLayout = () => {
  return <p>hello world</p>
}

Page.getLayout = function getLayout(page: ReactElement) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Page
```

When navigating between pages,  
we want to _persist_ page state (input values, scroll position, etc.) for a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience.

This layout pattern enables state persistence  
because the React component tree is maintained between page transitions.  
With the component tree, React can understand which elements have changed to preserve state.

> **Good to know**:  
> This process is called [reconciliation ↗](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state),  
> which is how React understands which elements have changed.

### Data Fetching

Inside your layout, you can fetch data on the client-side using `useEffect` or a library like [SWR ↗](https://swr.vercel.app/).  
Because layout file is not a **Page**, you cannot use `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.

```tsx filename="components/layout.tsx"
import useSWR from 'swr'
import Navbar from './navbar'
import Footer from './footer'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/navigation', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return (
    <>
      <Navbar links={data.links} />
      <main>{children}</main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}
```
