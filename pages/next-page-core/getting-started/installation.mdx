> Create a new Next.js application with `create-next-app`.

System Requirements: [Node.js 18.17 ↗] or later.

## Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using [`create-next-app`],  
which sets up everything automatically for you.

To create a project, run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

What is your project named? **your-app-name**  
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / **Yes**  
Would you like to use ESLint? No / **Yes**  
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / **Yes**  
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / **Yes**  
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / **Yes**  
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? **No** / Yes

After the prompts, [`create-next-app`] will create a folder with your project name  
and install the required dependencies.

If you're new to Next.js, see the [project structure] docs  
for an overview of all the possible files and folders in your application.

> **Good to know**:  
> Next.js now ships with [TypeScript], [ESLint], and [Tailwind CSS] configuration by default.  
> You can optionally use a [src directory] in the root of your project to  
> separate **your application's** code from **configuration** files.

## Runing Scripts

Open your `package.json` file and add the following `scripts`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "preview": "next build && next start --port 3456"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev`: runs [`next dev`][next cli] to start Next.js in development mode.
- `build`: runs [`next build`][next cli] to build the application for production usage.
- `start`: runs [`next start`][next cli] to start a Next.js production server.
- `lint`: runs [`next lint`][next cli] to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.
- `preview` runs `next build && next start --port 3456` to run production app at port 3456.

## Creating directories

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by  
how you structure your files.

### The `pages` directory

You can create a `pages/` directory at the root of your project.  
Then, add an `index.tsx` file inside your `pages` folder. This will be your home page (`/`):

```tsx filename="pages/index.tsx" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

Next, add an `_app.tsx` file inside `pages/` to define the **global layout**.  
Learn more about the [custom App file].

```tsx filename="pages/_app.tsx"
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

Finally, add a `_document.tsx` file inside `pages/` to control the initial response from the server.  
Learn more about the [custom Document file].

```tsx filename="pages/_document.tsx"
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**:  
> Although you can use both routers in the same project,  
> routes in `app` will be **prioritized** over `pages`.  
> We recommend **using only one router** in your new project to avoid confusion.

### The `public` folder

Create a `public` folder to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc.  
Files inside `public` directory can then be referenced by your code starting from  
the baseURL (`/`) or the import alias (`@/public/`).

## Run the Development Server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server (default port at 3000).
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
3. Edit `pages/index.tsx` file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.
