title: To Version 15 RC

> Upgrade your Next.js Application from Version 13 to 15.

## Upgrading from 13 to 14

To update to Next.js version 14, run the following command using your preferred package manager:

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm up next react react-dom eslint-config-next --latest
```

> **Good to know:**  
> If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their latest versions.

### v14 Summary

- The minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 16.14 to 18.17, since 16.x has reached end-of-life.
- The `next export` command has been removed in favor of `output: 'export'` config.  
  Please see the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.
- The `next/server` import for `ImageResponse` was renamed to `next/og`.  
  A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-og-import) to safely and automatically rename your imports.
- The `@next/font` package has been fully removed in favor of the built-in `next/font`.  
  A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#built-in-next-font) to safely and automatically rename your imports.
- The WASM target for `next-swc` has been removed.

## Upgrading from 14 to 15

To update to Next.js version 15, run the following command using your preferred package manager:

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm up next@rc react@rc react-dom@rc eslint-config-next@rc
```

> **Good to know:**  
> If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to the latest.

## Minimum React version

- The minimum `react` and `react-dom` is now **19**.

## `fetch` requests

[`fetch` requests](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) are no longer cached by default.

To opt specific `fetch` requests into caching, you can pass the `cache: 'force-cache'` option.

```js filename="app/layout.js" {3}
export default async function RootLayout() {
  const a = await fetch('https://...') // Not Cached
  const b = await fetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' }) // Cached

  // ...
}
```

To opt all `fetch` requests in a layout or page into caching,  
you can use the `export const fetchCache = 'default-cache'` [segment config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config).  
If individual `fetch` requests specify a `cache` option, that will be used instead.

```js filename="app/layout.js" {3}
// Since this is the root layout, all fetch requests in the app
// that don't set their own cache option will be cached.
export const fetchCache = 'default-cache'

export default async function RootLayout() {
  const a = await fetch('https://...') // Cached
  const b = await fetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' }) // Not cached

  // ...
}
```

## Route Handlers

`GET` functions in [Route Handlers](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) are no longer cached by default.

To opt `GET` methods into caching,  
you can use a [route config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) such as `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` in your Route Handler file.

```js filename="app/api/route.js" {1}
export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export async function GET() {}
```

## Client-side Router Cache

When navigating between pages via `<Link>` or `useRouter`,  
[page](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) segments are no longer reused from the client-side router cache.  
However, they are still reused during browser backward and forward navigation and for shared layouts.

To opt page segments into caching, you can use the [`staleTimes`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/staleTimes) config option:

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
      static: 180,
    },
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

[Layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout) and [loading states](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) are still cached and reused on navigation.

## `next/font`

The `@next/font` package has been **removed** in favor of the built-in [`next/font`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font).  
A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#built-in-next-font) to safely and automatically rename your imports.

```js filename="app/layout.js"
// Before
import { Inter } from '@next/font/google'

// After
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
```

## bundlePagesRouterDependencies

`experimental.bundlePagesExternals` is now **stable** and renamed to `bundlePagesRouterDependencies`.

```js filename="next.config.mjs" {9}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Before
  experimental: {
    bundlePagesExternals: true,
  },

  // After
  bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true,
}

export default nextConfig
```

## serverExternalPackages

`experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` is now **stable** and renamed to `serverExternalPackages`.

```js filename="next.config.mjs" {9}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Before
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['package-name'],
  },

  // After
  serverExternalPackages: ['package-name'],
}

export default nextConfig
```
