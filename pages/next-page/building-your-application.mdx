> Learn how to use Next.js features to build your application.

Next.js provides the building blocks to create flexible, full-stack web applications.  
The guides in **Building Your Application** explain  
how to use these features and how to customize your application's behavior.

The sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced,  
so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application.  
However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that  
apply to your use case.

We recommend starting with the [Routing](/next-page/building-your-application/routing), [Rendering](/next-page/building-your-application/rendering), [Data Fetching](/next-page/building-your-application/data-fetching) and [Styling](/next-page/building-your-application/styling) sections,  
as they introduce the fundamental Next.js and web concepts to help you get started.  
Then, you can dive deeper into the other sections such as [Optimizing](/next-page/building-your-application/optimizing) and [Configuring](/next-page/building-your-application/configuring).  
Finally, once you're ready, checkout the [Deploying](/next-page/building-your-application/deploying) and [Upgrading](/next-page/building-your-application/upgrading) sections.

> **Good To Know:**  
> Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js.  
> It used an intuitive file-system router to map each file to a route.  
> The Pages Router is still supported in newer versions of Next.js,  
> but **we recommend migrating** to the new [App Router](/docs/app) to leverage React's latest features.
