> Learn how to debug your Next.js application with VS Code or Chrome DevTools.

This documentation explains how you can debug your Next.js frontend and backend code  
with full source maps support using either the [VS Code debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) or [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).

Any debugger that can attach to Node.js can also be used to debug a Next.js application.  
You can find more details in the Node.js [Debugging Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).

## VS Code

Create a file named `.vscode/launch.json` at the root of your project with the following content:

```json filename="launch.json"
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug server-side",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug client-side",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug full stack",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/next",
      "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect"],
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
      "serverReadyAction": {
        "action": "debugWithEdge",
        "killOnServerStop": true,
        "pattern": "- Local:.+(https?://.+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s",
        "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`npm run dev` can be replaced with `pnpm dev` if you're using pnpm.

If you're [changing the port number](/next-page/api-reference/next-cli#development) your application starts on,  
replace the `3000` in `http://localhost:3000` with the port you're using instead.

If you're running Next.js from a directory other than root (for example, if you're using Turborepo)  
then you need to add `cwd` to the server-side and full stack debugging tasks.  
For example, `"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/apps/web"`.

Now go to the Debug panel (`Ctrl+Shift+D` on Windows/Linux, `⇧+⌘+D` on macOS), select a launch configuration,  
then press `F5` or select **Debug: Start Debugging** from the Command Palette to start your debugging session.

## Chrome DevTools

### Client-side code

Start your development server as usual by running `pnpm dev`.  
Once the server starts, open `http://localhost:3000` (or your alternate URL) in Chrome.  
Next, open Chrome's Developer Tools (`⌥+⌘+I` on macOS), then go to the **Sources** tab.

Now, any time your client-side code reaches a [`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger) statement,  
code execution will pause and that file will appear in the debug area.  
You can also press `⌘+P` on macOS to search for a file and set breakpoints manually.  
Note that when searching here, your source files will have paths starting with `webpack://_N_E/./`.

### Server-side code

To debug server-side Next.js code with Chrome DevTools,  
you need to pass the [`--inspect`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_inspect_host_port) flag to the underlying Node.js process:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev"
  }
}
```

Launching the Next.js dev server with the `--inspect` flag will look something like this:

```bash filename="Terminal"
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/0cf90313-350d-4466-a748-cd60f4e47c95
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

> **Be aware**:  
> running `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' npm run dev` or `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' yarn dev` won't work.  
> This would try to start multiple debuggers on the same port: one for the npm/yarn process and one for Next.js.  
> You would then get an error like `Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use` in your console.

Once the server starts, open a new tab in Chrome and visit `chrome://inspect`,  
where you should see your Next.js application inside the **Remote Target** section.  
Click **inspect** under your application to open a separate DevTools window, then go to the **Sources** tab.

Debugging server-side code here works much like debugging client-side code with Chrome DevTools,  
except that when you search for files here with `⌘+P`,  
your source files will have paths starting with `webpack://{application-name}/./`  
where `{application-name}` will be replaced with the name of your application according to your `package.json` file.
