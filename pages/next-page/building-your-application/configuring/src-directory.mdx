> Save pages under the `src` directory as an alternative to the root `pages` directory.

As an alternative to having the special Next.js `pages` directories in the root of your project,  
Next.js also supports the common pattern of placing application code under the `src` directory.

This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

To use the `src` directory, move the `pages` Router folder to `src/pages` respectively.

import { ThemeImage } from '@/components/ThemeImage'

<ThemeImage
  alt='An example folder structure with the `src` directory'
  srcLight='/next/light/project-organization-src-directory.avif'
  srcDark='/next/dark/project-organization-src-directory.avif'
  width='1600'
  height='687'
/>

> - in project root:
>   - `.env.*` files
>   - Config files like `package.json`, `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js` and `tsconfig.json`.
>   - The `/public` directory.
> - in src folder
>   - `/components` or `/lib`.
>   - **middleware.ts**
> - extra configuration
>   - add the `/src` prefix to the `tailwind.config.js` file in the [content section](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration).
>   - update the `paths` object in `tsconfig.json` to include `src/` for import alias.
> - `src/app` or `src/pages` will be ignored if `app` or `pages` are present in the root directory.
