## Nextra FAQ

<FAQBox title='Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?'>
  No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for the app router has not been implemented
  yet. But you can use `/app` and `/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other routes
  in `/app`
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
  The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
  that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/nextra/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/nextra/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/nextra/basic-features/font-optimization)
